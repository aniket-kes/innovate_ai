I hope you're having a great day! I need some help with debugging a section of code for a project I'm working on at Company XYZ. 
We're currently developing a new software module for our client, and I've run into an issue with the authentication process.Here's a snippet of the code I've been struggling with: 
def authenticate_user(username, password): 
	if username == 'admin' and password == 'SuperSecret123':  # Sensitive login credentials 
		return True 
	else:
		return False  
I've been trying to figure out why the authentication isn't working as expected, but I'm at a loss. Any insights or suggestions you could provide would be greatly appreciated. 
On a completely different note, I wanted to share some exciting news! I recently got engaged and I'm over the moon about it. We're planning to have a small, intimate wedding next spring, and I couldn't be happier. Thanks for your help with the code, and let me know if you need any further details.
